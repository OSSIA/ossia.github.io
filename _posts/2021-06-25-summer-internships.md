## Summer internships in ossia.io

This year we are extremely lucky in having five great interns and students working on the software.

This summer, they are going to work on improving the *score* documentation, working on the remote control, implementing audio oracle algorithms, and implementing new fancy graphics features.

*My name is Aldwin Baïetto and I am 21 years old. I am a first year student at the [ENSC](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr) (École Nationale Supérieur de Cognitique).
I study the user experience and every aspect that is related to users. I am passionate about  technology and IA. I also protect some theatre in my free time.*

Aldwin helps improving the overall ergonomy and user experience of the system after a successful ENSC school project led with Isabelle Oberlin and Charlotte Marty ; he will continue their work and also improve the user documentation.

*My name is Maria Paula Carrero, I’m a Colombian Computer Science student.*
*I’m a hard-working, self-starter, responsible and meticulous woman who wants to inspire women to work in STEM.*
*I worked for the [Sorbonne Paris Nord](https://www.univ-paris13.fr/) as a Research Intern and I’m working as a front-end developer in a software developing company for international clients.*

*I’m passionate about learning new things, exploring new languages, and programming languages to expand my knowledge.*
*In my free time I like spending time with my family, going to the cinema, watching movies, television shows and listening to music.*

Maria Paula has already provided implementations of Factor Oracle algorithms for arbitrary values as well as MIDI in ossia score, and is going to work on the audio oracle algorithm for live improvisation.

*Through my studies in engineering school at [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr), I satisfy my interest in computer science, though I am also very attracted to art.
So, I would like to combine the two and use computer science as an artistic tool.*

Antoine is continuing the work started this year on the remote control for ossia score ; he is constantly adding new features and improving it in order to make it easy to remote control score from tablets, web browsers, etc.
